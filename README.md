# SCHOOL District Analysis
 The following program was run using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas & Python
 ## Overview of Project
List of deliverables for the analysis of the school district:

A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
Schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size
School performance based on the type of school

**Before we can begin these tasks, we need to import the datasets into Jupyter Notebook using Python.

###Resources
Data Source: Student_Data_Challenge_Starter_Code.ipynb file and rename it Pyber_Analysis.ipynb.
Software: Python 3.9, Visual Studio Code 1.50.0, Anaconda 4.8.5, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4, Pandas
For more information, read the Documentation on Pandas DataFrame.

*SUMMARY
While conducting this analysis, I made a few discoveries with the data between Charter type schools and public schools. Charter types have a higher performance score on a lower budget as opposed to public schools.
This could be a result of them allocating their resources carefully and investing in the right tools for student success. Also, as supported by the data, Charter types have a higher reading and math score. By looking at the data, while it is true that public schools have a higher budget overall, they also tend to have more students. This shows why publlic schools have varying data such as how grade 12s perform better in public school than the grade 12s at charter type schools as depicted
